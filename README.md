## Dataset and Preprocessing

### Dataset Used
- **Food-101 Dataset**: 101 food categories with 101,000 images (1,000 per class).  
- **Nutritional Dataset**: Contains calorie and nutrient information, merged with Food-101 categories.

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Image Preprocessing**:  
   - Resized to 224x224 pixels  
   - Normalized pixel values to [0, 1]  

2. **Augmentation**:  
   - Random rotation, horizontal flipping, zooming, brightness adjustments  

3. **Data Splitting**:  
   - 70% training, 20% validation, 10% testing  

4. **Label Encoding**:  
   - Food categories ‚Üí numerical labels  
   - Nutritional values scaled using `MinMaxScaler` for regression

## Algorithms and Models Used

### a. Food Classification Model
- **Model**: EfficientNetB0 (pre-trained on ImageNet)  
- **Reason**: High accuracy with low computational cost  
- **Architecture**:  
  - Base EfficientNetB0 for feature extraction  
  - Custom fully connected layers for 101-class classification  
  - Output Layer: Softmax activation  

### b. Freshness Prediction
- **Model**: Custom CNN  
- **Architecture**:  
  - 3 convolutional layers + ReLU  
  - MaxPooling and Dropout  
  - Sigmoid output layer for binary classification (Fresh / Not Fresh)

### c. Calorie and Nutritional Estimation
- **Approach**:  
  - Features extracted using EfficientNetB0  
  - Linear Regression model predicts calories and nutrients (protein, fat, carbs)  

### d. Chatbot with NLP
- **Model**: BERT-based Hugging Face model for intent recognition  
- **Capabilities**:  
  - Understands user queries related to food  
  - Provides insights like:  
    - "Is this food suitable for children?"  
    - "What are alternatives for this food?"

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Training Steps
1. Initialized EfficientNetB0 with frozen layers, then fine-tuned  
2. Trained freshness model on manually labeled data  
3. Trained calorie estimation regression on extracted features  

### Training Details
- Optimizer: Adam  
- Loss Functions:  
  - Categorical Cross-Entropy (classification)  
  - Binary Cross-Entropy (freshness)  
  - Mean Squared Error (calorie/nutrition)  
- Batch Size: 32  
- Epochs: 20  

### Evaluation Metrics
- Classification Accuracy (food identification)  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score (freshness prediction)  
- Mean Absolute Error (calorie/nutrition regression)

4. **Nutritional Analysis**: Regression model predicts calories and nutrient breakdown  
5. **Chatbot Interaction**: User queries handled by BERT-based NLP model  
6. **Output Display**:  
   - Predicted food category  
   - Freshness status  
   - Nutritional values and calorie count  
   - Dietary advice
